# About my first project on GitHub
## I'm going to use every feature of markup in this project, ideally on every line
### so to begin with, 3 types of headers
#### Is there a 4th?
##### what about a 5th?
###### I feel like I'm falling down a mine
####### is this a race to the bottom?


######## I guess the hashtags confirm Github will only allow me go to 6th

not only that won't even line break


**until I figure how to line break I'll just test different features, this is meant to bolden a text on markup**
*and this will italicise, but I've created a bullet point without even realising* 
_so will this_
_I just figured out I control I and B texts it will just convert it to markup, quicker, right?_
**Hello, this text is _extremely_ important**
  	<sup> I'm skipping features like this, I never use it </sup>
   > Text that is a quote

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
`#ffffff` 


guess that doesn't work for changing background colour of readme file

Some body text of this section.

<a name="my-custom-anchor-point"></a>
Some text I want to provide a direct link to, but which doesn't have its own heading.
